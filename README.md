# Welcome to CollabCam

**CollabCam** is a dynamic web platform specifically built to facilitate **online coding interviews**. Designed to streamline the interview process, CollabCam allows interviewers to engage with candidates in real-time through a collaborative environment that integrates coding, monitoring, and communication tools.

With CollabCam, interviewers can initiate a new session, share the unique session code with candidates, and dive into an interactive interview experience that mirrors the dynamics of an in-person coding test.

## Key Features

- ### **Collaborative Code Editor**
  CollabCam features a **live coding editor** where candidates can write, edit, and debug code directly in the interview session. The shared editor updates in real-time, allowing interviewers to observe the candidate’s approach, provide feedback, and guide them through technical questions or coding challenges seamlessly.

- ### **Video Monitoring**
  To ensure integrity and focus, CollabCam includes a **video monitoring tool** that tracks head movements of the candidate. When a candidate turns on their video, CollabCam will monitor and detect excessive head movements:
  - If notable movement is detected, CollabCam issues a **warning**.
  - Continued movement post-warning may result in the **session being terminated**, allowing interviewers to maintain a controlled environment.

- ### **In-Session Chat**
  CollabCam also provides a built-in **chat feature** for smooth communication between the interviewer and candidate. Whether discussing the task at hand, providing hints, or addressing technical issues, the chat function ensures clear and effective interaction throughout the session.

> **Note**: Currently, CollabCam’s functionality is optimized for users connected on the same network due to limitations with the current PeerJS implementation. The development roadmap includes plans to expand this capability, enabling users to connect from any network globally.

## Future Scope

We have exciting plans for future updates that will enhance CollabCam’s utility:
- **Session Management**: Enable interviewers to conduct consecutive interviews without needing to reset the platform, making back-to-back interviews seamless.
- **Scoring and Feedback**: Add functionality for interviewers to assign scores, write feedback, and maintain a log of candidate performance over multiple sessions.
